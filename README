USB Serial Lib Demo
===================

This is a simple demonstration of the USB Serial Lib available at
https://github.com/ecgtheow/usbseriallib

It shows:

*    How to initialise all known USB serial devices when the activity is
     created (see UsbSerial.java:onCreate())

*    How to listen to a USB device attach intent, and report the attach to the
     main activity (see UsbAttached.java)

*    How to receive data from the USB device (see UsbSerial.java:onReadData())

The device attach intent is defined in AndroidManifest.xml.
